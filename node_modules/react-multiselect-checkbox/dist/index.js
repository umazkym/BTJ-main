/**

 * @param {Object} target A target object to lazy load. Lazy loading in this case means deferring an operation on the object
 *                        when it is used for the very first time by the client code.
 * @param {Object} options The options of the lazy loading.
 * @param {Function} onceCallback The callback to execute only once before performing the very first operation on the given "target"
 *                                when the given "target" is used for the very first time.
 *                                This callback is mandatory (otherwise it doesn't make sense to use "lazy()" at all)
 *                                and allows e.g. to perform a heavy initialization operation lazily on the underlying target object.
 * @param {Object} [options.ignoredTypes] The types which prototypes to ignore when going up the prototype chain in order to identify
 *                                        which prototypes to intercept when lazy loading.
 *                                        By default, only the properties set on the "Object" prototype will be ignored.
 *                                        This option can be used e.g. to avoid the performance of a heavy lazy initialization
 *                                        when calling the methods of a parent class of the given "target" object.
 * @param {boolean} [options.interceptConstructor] Whether or not to intercept the getting/setting of the "constructor" property.
 *                                                 Defaults to "false", meaning that when getting/setting "target.constructor",
 *                                                 this operation will not trigger the underlying lazy loading.
 * @param {string[]} [options.propertiesToIgnore] Property names or method names to ignore for lazy loading.
 * @param {Array} [options.pointcuts] Array of pointcut shorthands to use for interception and lazy loading.
 *                                    By default, only "call", "get" and "set" pointcuts will be used.
 *                                    Other pointcut shorthands (e.g. "apply", "construct") will be ignored, if passed.
 * @return {Proxy} A new proxy object for the given target which supports lazy loading.

/**
 * Factory method to create a new immutable linked ordered map.
 *
 * @param {Array} [initialItems] Initial array of items to add to the map (defaults to an empty array).
 *                               Each item of the map MUST be an object with the following shape:
 *
 *                                   {
 *                                       [keyPropName]: keyPropValue,
 *                                       property: propertyValue,
 *                                       otherProperty: otherPropertyValue,
 *                                       ...
 *                                   }
 *
 *                               Where "[keyPropName]" is the name of the key property of the item.
 *                               In this case the map will map the value "keyPropValue" (the key)
 *                               to the whole item, which will be treated as the value of the map value, e.g.:
 *
 *                                   const map = new ImmutableLinkedOrderedMap({
 *                                       initialItems: [
 *                                           {
 *                                              id: 1, // <--- "[keyPropName] === 'id'"
 *                                              property: "A value",
 *                                              // ...
 *                                           },
 *                                           {
 *                                              id: 2,
 *                                              property: "Another value",
 *                                              // ...
 *                                           },
 *                                           // ...
 *                                       ]
 *                                   })
 *                                   map.get(2) // Will return: { id: 2, property: "Another value" }
 *
 *                               Or an object with a single property with the following shape (useful for primitives):
 *
 *                                   {
 *                                       key: value
 *                                   }
 *
 *                               In this case the map will map the key "key" to the value "value", and "value"
 *                               will be treated as the value of the map for the key "key", e.g.:
 *
 *                                   const map = new ImmutableLinkedOrderedMap({
 *                                       initialItems: [
 *                                           {
 *                                              key1: "abc"
 *                                           },
 *                                           {
 *                                              key2: "def"
 *                                           },
 *                                           // ...
 *                                       ]
 *                                   })
 *                                   map.get("key1") // Will return: "abc"
 *
 *                               Both items' shapes may coexist in the same map if client code is mixing pears with apples.
 *
 *                               Note that if an object with a single property which name is "[keyPropName]" is given,
 *                               then the whole object will be mapped and treated as the map's value, e.g. when "keyPropName === 'id'":
 *
 *                                   const map = new ImmutableLinkedOrderedMap({
 *                                       initialItems: [
 *                                           {
 *                                              id: 123
 *                                           },
 *                                           {
 *                                              id: 456
 *                                           },
 *                                           ...
 *                                       ]
 *                                   })
 *                                   map.get(123) // Will return: { id: 123 }
 *
 *                               The same item format is used for all mutation operations where an item or items may be given as parameters,
 *                               e.g. for "set", "replace", etc... .
 *
 * @param {string} [keyPropName] The name of the key property of an item which value should be used for the key of the map (defaults to "id").
 * @param {number} mode The mode of the map (a value of the enum-like object "ImmutableLinkedOrderedMapMode").
 *                      By default, the map will be in single mode ("ImmutableLinkedOrderedMapMode.SINGLE"),
 *                      which means it will only allow a single mutation operation per linked ordered immutable map instance.
 *                      This mode allows faster lookups as the version tree of the map will consist of only
 *                      one branch and should cover almost all practical use cases.
 *                      E.g.:
 *
 *                          const map = new ImmutableLinkedOrderedMap() // "ImmutableLinkedOrderedMapMode.SINGLE" is the default mode.
 *                          const item = { id: 1, value: "A value" }
 *                          const newMap = map.set(item)
 *                          //const anotherNewMapFromMap = map.set({ id: 2, value: "Another value" }) // This line, if uncommented, will throw an error in single mode, as a mutation operation already occurred on "map"!
 *                          const anotherNewMapFromNewMap = newMap.set({ id: 2, value: "Another value" }) // This will work, as a mutation operation did not occur yet on "newMap".
 *                          const yetAnotherMap = newMap.set(item) // This works, because "newMap === yetAnotherMap" as the given item is the same and already existed in "newMap".
 *                          //const thisMapWouldNotWork = newMap.set({ id: 3, value: "Yet another value" }) // This will throw an error in single mode as for "anotherNewMapFromMap".
 *                          // ...
 *
 *                      The version tree of this map in single mode will look like the following:
 *
 *                          map (Initial version)
 *                             \
 *                             newMap/yetAnotherMap (Second version, remember, in this case "newMap === yetAnotherMap")
 *                                \
 *                                anotherNewMapFromNewMap (Third version)
 *
 *                      The other available mode is multiway mode ("ImmutableLinkedOrderedMapMode.MULTIWAY").
 *                      In this mode, multiple mutation operations can occur on the same map, each leading to a different
 *                      branch.
 *                      Lookups may be slower, particularly if a lot of mutation operations have happened,
 *                      as the structural sharing code will need to determine the right branch of the version tree
 *                      given a map which tries to lookup its data for a given key.
 *                      E.g.:
 *
 *                          const map = new ImmutableLinkedOrderedMap({
 *                              mode: ImmutableLinkedOrderedMapMode.MULTIWAY
 *                          })
 *                          const newMap = map.set({ id: 1, value: "A value" })
 *                          const anotherNewMapFromMap = map.set({ id: 2, value: "Another value" }) // This will work in multiway mode, but not in single mode.
 *                          const anotherNewMapFromNewMap = newMap.set({ id: 2, value: "Another value" })
 *                          // ...
 *
 *                      The version tree of this map in multiway mode will look like the following:
 *
 *                                                                             map (Initial version, root node)
 *                                                                            /   \
 *                                                                           /     newMap (Second version, first branch)
 *                                                                          /        \
 *                          (Third version, second branch) anotherNewMapFromMap       \
 *                                                                                    anotherNewMapFromNewMap (Fourth version, first branch)
 *
 *                      This mode should be used only if client code needs to perform several mutation operations on the same map instance over time.
 *                      Also, a single mode map cannot become a multiway and viceversa.
 *
 *                      The last available mode is lightweight mode ("ImmutableLinkedOrderedMapMode.LIGHTWEIGHT").
 *                      This mode is the most restrictive and does not allow to perform any operation on a map on which a mutation operation
 *                      has occurred (basically once a mutation operation occurs on a map, it becomes useless and only the new map
 *                      could be used further).
 *                      The advantage is that a map in this mode will have the fastest lookups, as in this mode there isn't any version tree.
 *                      E.g.:
 *
 *                          const map = new ImmutableLinkedOrderedMap({
 *                              mode: ImmutableLinkedOrderedMapMode.LIGHTWEIGHT
 *                          })
 *                          const item = { id: 1, value: "A value" }
 *                          const newMap = map.set(item)
 *                          //const anotherNewMapFromMap = map.set({ id: 2, value: "Another value" }) // This line, if uncommented, will throw an error in lightweight mode, as with single mode.
 *                          //const value = map.get(1) // In lightweight mode, even this line will throw an error, as after a mutation operation occurs on a map, it will become useless.
 *                          const valueOfNewMap = newMap.get(1) // This works.
 *                          const anotherNewMapFromNewMap = newMap.unset(1) // This will also work, and from this point on, "newMap" will become useless and a further operation will have to be performed on "anotherNewMapFromNewMap"
 *                          // ...
 *
 *                      Note that the mentioned version tree is only an abstraction, a conceptual idea behind the structural sharing code of the map.
 *                      Internally, the structural sharing code does not create any tree.
 *                      For multiway mode, though, the structural sharing code keeps track of the version of the map in a string
 *                      which is then used to determine if a map is a descendant of another one during lookup operations.
 * @return {ImmutableLinkedOrderedMap} The new immutable linked ordered map.

//
//	1. Enforce API surface and semantic compatibility with 1.9.x branch
//	2. Improve the module's maintainability by reducing the storage

//	3. Use the same single mechanism to support "private" and "user" data.
//	4. _Never_ expose "private" data to user code (TODO: Drop _data, _removeData)
//	5. Avoid exposing implementation details on user objects (eg. expando properties)
//	6. Provide a clear path for implementation upgrade to WeakMap in 2014
